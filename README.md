# Implementation-of-IDS/IPS-with-Snort

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are essential for protecting networks from malicious attacks and unauthorized access. IDS detects potential threats, while IPS actively blocks them in real-time. Together, they enhance network security, prevent data breaches, and ensure uninterrupted service. 

Today, I am going to use Snort for this purpose. Snort is a popular open-source tool.
